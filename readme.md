## About

> [!WARNING]

It is designed to be simple, modern, and modular, featuring a modern C++ core library, reactive UI, and a capability-based microkernel. skiftOS values simplicity, modernity, and modularity, and has several notable features such as multi-architecture support and easy hackability. It is free and open-source under the MIT license.
